# Early_Patient_Readmission_Prediction
Developed a machine learning pipeline to predict early patient readmissions using a decade of clinical records from 130 US hospitals. Extensive data preprocessing was performed, class imbalance was addressed using SMOTE, and multiple models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest were evaluated.
